# **Methods**

# Declare a method (nothing gets executed, I just assign the method!)
def say_hello
    puts "Hello!"
  end
  
  # Call the method
  say_hello
  
  
  
  def reverse_name(name)
    return name.reverse # it's not going to print, but just give it back in my code!
  end
  
  puts "My name reversed is #{reverse_name("gabriele")}"
